            Working as a experimental propulsion scientist at NASA has always forced me to keep up with the latest trends in propulsion technology and one day while watching apollo 13,again, I discovered this site as well as a few others based around the idea of getting to the moon. After studying the science of the system this seems to be the only remotely viable solution. I however am unsure as to the science behind the DIY space suits.
