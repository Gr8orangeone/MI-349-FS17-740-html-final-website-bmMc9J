            As a loan officer I have a very busy week, But weekends are for me. On the weekends I like to learn new things and build stuff. As a young girl I always wanted to go to the moon but due to the stoppage after the last moon landing I all but lost hope in ever going to the moon that's when I found out about Bounce me to the moon. All it took to get my dreams going was a few weekends of hard work and a little bit of money! But I couldn't be happier I plan to do a test launch this upcoming weekend.
