            I have Never been afraid of heights, I actually want to get higher and higher. However due to liability concerns the carnival limits the heights I can get to. When I saw how easy it was to build a working prototype for the DBMTTM 9000 (Double Bounce Me to the Moon 9000) I quickly ordered everything that I needed and started planning the build right away. I hope to go down in history as the highest flying trapeze artist
